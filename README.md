# Angels Portfolio

## Description

This repository was used to create a portfolio that will be used for future projects. In this portfolio there are work samples so that job employers can assess if I am a candidate for their position. This is the first major project that I have created and throughout the project I overcame many blocks that taught me many things about coding in general.
